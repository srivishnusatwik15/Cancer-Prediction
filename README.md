# Cancer-Prediction

Assign-1:

Objective: 1. Classify breast tumour dataset into 2 classes i.e, benign or malignant using machine learning models like- Logistic Regression, SVM , Neural Network.

2. Evaluate the model accuracy.

About Dataset: The given dataset is made up with fine needle aspiration biopsy reports where a thin needle is inserted into abnormal tissue or fluid, aiding in diagnosis or excluding conditions like cancer. The dataset contains a total 569 number of biopsy out of which 357 are benign, 212 are malignant. Column ‘diagnosis’ contains the report. [M—-Malignant, B——Benign]. The features this dataset contains are as follows

Parameters: Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

b) texture (Standard deviation of gray-scale values)

c) perimeter

d) area

e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

f) compactness (perimeter*2 / area - 1.0)

g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

i) symmetry

j) fractal dimension

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features.
